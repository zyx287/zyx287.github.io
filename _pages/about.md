I'm currently a visiting scientist at Janelia Research Campus, advised by Dr. Jiefu Li. Before joining Li Lab, I got my bachelor's degree at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/). 

My research experiences include:   
  - Computational Biology
    - Computational bioimaging
    - Deep learning
    - Structural bioinformatics   
  - Developmental Biology
    - Neuronal cell biology in cerebellar cortex
    - Neuron morphology analysis
  - Biochemistry and Chemical Biology
    - Structural biology
    - Structure-based drug design
  - Protein Design
    - Design membrane proteins that function as biosensors
    - Develop fluorescence lifetime-based sensors
