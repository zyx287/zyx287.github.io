I'm currently a research assistant at Janelia Research Campus, advised by Dr. Jiefu Li. Before joining in Li Lab, I got my bachelor degree at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/). 

My research experiences include:   
  - Computational Biology
    - Computational bioimaging
    - Deep learning
    - Molecular dynamics simulation   
  - Developmental Biology
    - Neuronal cell biology in cerebellum
    - Neuron morphology analysis
  - Biochemistry and Chemical Biology
    - Atomic mechanism of G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs)
    - Structure-based drug design
  - Protein Design
    - Design membrane proteins that function as biosensors
    - Combine structural dynamics into rational protein design
